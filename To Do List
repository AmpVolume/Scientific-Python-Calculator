✅ CORE FEATURES
 Arithmetic operations

 Trig functions with DEG/RAD toggle

 Square root, exponent, logarithms

 Evaluation engine with eval & safety

 History window

 GUI with tkinter

🔁 TO-DO LIST:
✅ 🔹 1. Advanced Math Capabilities
 Add factorial n!

 Add modulus %

 Add inverse trig functions (asin, acos, atan)

 Add hyperbolic trig functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)

 Add nth root (e.g. ⁿ√x)

 Add log base n (e.g. log2(x))

✅🔹 2. Expression Enhancements
 Add expression parser to auto-balance parentheses

 Add support for ANS (previous answer)

 Add memory buttons: M+, M-, MR, MC

 Add ability to type full expressions directly (e.g. "sin(30)+log(10)")

 Syntax highlighting (colored parentheses or bold current token)

✅🔹 3.  User Interface
 Theme switcher: Light / Dark mode toggle

 Display DEG/RAD mode on screen persistently

 Responsive layout (e.g. pack or grid with weight)

 Add a secondary small text line for showing full expression (like modern calculators)

 Virtual keypad for touchscreen use

🔹 4.  Visualization Features
 Plot function graphs (using matplotlib)

 Plot derivatives or definite integrals over ranges

 Add a unit converter (length, temperature, etc.)

🔹 5. 🔐 Security + Eval Safety
 Replace eval() with a safe math parser (e.g. sympy, asteval, or mathjs)

 Add try/except for domain errors (e.g. log(-1))

🔹 6. 🧠 Learning/Help Features
 Add tooltip help (e.g. hover over sin( to show "sine in degrees/radians")

 Add "Scientific Help" window with guides

 Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

🔹 7. 📂 Export/Import Features
 Save and load history to/from .txt or .json

 Export graph or result as image/PDF

 Save/load favorite expressions or presets

🔹 8. 🌐 Online Integration (Optional)
 Pull real constants from a web API (e.g. Planck’s constant, atomic mass)

 Currency conversion API

 Sync history to a cloud file

🔹 9. 📱 Platform & Deployment
 Package as .exe using pyinstaller or cx_Freeze

 Convert to a web app (with Flask + HTML UI or Streamlit)

 Android/iOS mobile version (using Kivy or BeeWare)

🔚 Summary
By completing this list, you’ll build a scientific calculator that:

Has more functionality than most mobile apps

Includes plotting, memory, parsing, and learning tools

Runs as a desktop or web app

Can be extended for STEM, education, or finance use cases
